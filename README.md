# Physics Blog
<a href="https://physics-blog-production.up.railway.app/">Physics Blog</a><b> &#x21E6; Website Link</b>
<br>
This is a website for physics lover bloggers.
I have used <b>Django</b> to create this website. I have created two apps on this website namely <em>Blogs</em> and <em>User</em>.
<em><strong>Blogs</strong></em> app deals with how our website looks like creating, updating and deleting a blog, posts by a specific user and the total number of posts to display in one page.
While <em><b>User</b></em> app deals with all user-related stuff such as new user registration, login, logout, user profile and forgot password.
